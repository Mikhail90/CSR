Creative Service Requests Form

This is an application built for KC. 

Objectives: 
To make an interface that will allow requests to make a request. 

Once the request is made, KC should be notified. 

KC will have an administrative screen, with an inline table with a few fields marking the current request.

AJAX will be used to allow in-line approvals and assignments within CSR(Preassigned emails)

Clicking on a Job ID/Request will take the admin user to a specific detail page for each request. This page will have edit abilities and a section for additional content. (AJAX will be considered for this as well)
